# Verifiable-Voting-Dao

The project aims to develop a system for verifiable on/off chain DAO voting with ballot privacy using storage proofs on the Cairo network. I'll try to explain everything below and note, this is open to further changes as time goes by and the project progresses.

1. Verifiable DAO Voting: The project focuses on enabling voting within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This involves creating a mechanism that ensures the integrity of the voting process, allowing participants to verify that their votes are counted accurately.

2. On/Off Chain Voting: The system will support both on-chain and off-chain voting methods. On-chain voting takes place directly on the blockchain, while off-chain voting allows participants to vote using external systems or platforms. I would be focusing 

3. Ballot Privacy: Privacy plays a crucial role in voting systems. The project emphasizes protecting the privacy of voters by employing cryptographic techniques and privacy-enhancing protocols. This ensures that individual votes remain confidential, safeguarding the anonymity of participants.

4. Storage Proofs on Cairo Network: The project leverages the capabilities of the Cairo network, a blockchain platform, to generate storage proofs. Storage proofs allow participants to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data stored on the blockchain.

By combining these components, the project aims to develop a secure and privacy-preserving voting system for DAOs. It represents an innovative and decentralized approach to voting, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques to enhance transparency and trust in the voting process.

Ultimately, the project's goal is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for verifiable DAO voting with ballot privacy, empowering participants to make informed decisions within decentralized decision-making structures.
